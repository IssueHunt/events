## What is IssueHunt Fest?

IssueHunt Fest is a month long online sponsorship event for open-source projects, organized by an issue-based bounty platform for OSS called [IssueHunt](https://issuehunt.io). 

We first announced about IssueHunt Fest 2018 Winter on [this article](https://medium.com/issuehunt/issuehunt-fest-2018-make-open-source-sustainable-58c21d5ac004).

The event take place every year in April and December. At the event we distribute sponsored money to promising OSS listed on IssueHunt.

## Mission

We organized IssueHunt Fest with a simple mission in mind: to create a sustainable open source ecosystem.

We think enthusiastic open source developers are not appropriately rewarded no matter how much they contribute to the technology evolution.

Many leading projects use open-source software, but no matter how they are essential, the owners of those projects juggle multiple jobs to sustain their living.

We want to fix this situation by nurturing a healthy open-source ecosystem.

Although we held the event for the first time in 2018 winter, developer from over 121 countries participated contributing to various projects through IssueHunt.
